# AntminerLinuxPowershell
One of the hash boards is going bad on my Antminer Z9 and a soft reset corrects the issue when it stops hashing. Instead of going in and fixing the board I attempted to automate the reset and learn powershell 7 on linux so that my script would be cross compatible with windows also. 
Eventually I want to run this script on a Raspberry pi Zero on boot for a later project.
